# Face-Detection-Python-and-OpenCV

This repository contains code for face detection using Haar Cascades in OpenCV.

Installation
To run this code, you will need to have OpenCV installed on your system. If you don't already have it installed, you can download it from the official OpenCV website.

This will start the script and open a window showing the output of the face detection algorithm.

By default, the script will use the default camera on your system as input. If you want to use a video file as input, you can modify the code by changing the VideoCapture argument to the path of the file.

The script will continuously capture frames from the input and detect faces in real-time. Detected faces will be highlighted with blue rectangles. To stop the script, press the "ESC" key.
